1. Navigate to the `backend` folder:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder and add your MongoDB connection string:
   ```
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/real-time-notes
   PORT=5000
   ```

4. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### **3. Set Up the Frontend**

1. Navigate to the `frontend` folder:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

### **4. Deploy the Application**

#### **Backend Deployment**
1. Deploy the backend to **Render** or **Heroku**.
2. Update the `.env` file with the production MongoDB URI.

#### **Frontend Deployment**
1. Deploy the frontend to **Vercel**.
2. Update the `SocketContext.jsx` file with the deployed backend URL.

## **Usage**

1. Open the application in your browser.
2. Enter a unique room ID and click **Join Room**.
3. Start creating or editing notes in real-time with other users in the same room.
4. View the list of online users in the room.

## **Key Concepts**

### **1. WebSockets**
- **Socket.io** is used to establish a real-time, bidirectional communication channel between the client and server.
- Events like `joinRoom`, `updateNote`, and `userJoined` are used to synchronize data across clients.

### **2. Rooms**
- Users can join specific rooms using a unique room ID.
- Socket.io's `room` feature ensures that messages are only broadcast to users in the same room.

### **3. Real-Time Updates**
- When a user edits a note, the changes are sent to the server via Socket.io.
- The server broadcasts the updated note to all users in the same room.

### **4. State Management**
- React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks are used to manage and update the application state.
- The `SocketContext` provides a global instance of the Socket.io client.
